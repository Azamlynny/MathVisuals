# Math Visuals
Various mathematical visualizations which I made as an interest could be found here.

## Projects
<img src="/Images/Double_Pendulum.PNG">
A physics simulation of a double pendulum is shown above.
<img src="/Images/Ulam_Spiral.PNG">
An Ulam Spiral is shown above, a visualization showing patterns in the distribution of prime numbers. The line shown in blue is modelled by the equation x^2+x+41, known as Euler's prime-generating polynomial. 
<img src="/Images/Golden_Ratio.PNG">
Above is a program which simulates how nature uses the golden ratio. The cricles can be imagined as seeds from a plant, which the plant can only disperse by rotating the next seed from the last one. The most spread out seeds can be found when each seed is rotated by the golden ratio from the last one.
<img src="/Images/Dragon_Curve.PNG">
A fractal called a dragon curve is shown above. A dragon curve is produced when a piece of paper is folded over itself in the same direction and then unfolded so that each fold creates a 90 degree angle.

## Additional Information
The source code from each project could be found in the project's respective folder.
